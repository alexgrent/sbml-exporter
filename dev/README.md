# SBMLExporter Handover #

The SBML Export runs as detailed in the main README. 

Here I include three further documents.

##Remaining TODO items

This details the remaining TODO markers in the code and why they are still there. There is nothing urgent about them.

## Unknown PhysicalEntity

This details what to do if the Unknown Physical Entity Warning is encountered during an export. 

Note: Encountering this warning does not halt the export or produce invalid output. The SBML file produced will be missing some notes/annotations/SBOTerms.

## Unrecognised database

This details what to do if the Unrecognised database warning is encountered during an export.

Note: Encountering this warning does not halt the export or produce invalid output. The SBML file produced will be missing some annotations.
